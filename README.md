Project working name: Optionstrader
The name is not final.
This project will one day be used to analyze the stock market in an open source fashion, so it will need to have a name which allows for the analysis of many markets.

Background
The purpose of this project is to make 1 million dollars.  We will make 1 million dollars distributed into 100 separate accounts each held by different people for the purpose of testing
a privatized Universal Basic Income. Each person should invest between $100 and $20,000 and they will be provided with a recommended option chain to purchase, if they so choose, at differing intervals
such as: "As fast as possible (~ Continuously)", "Minutely", "Hourly", "Daily", "Weekly", "Monthly". The average amount of money in all of the accounts must be within a 100% margin of the lowest amount
of money invested on the platform.  The reason for this is because we want to ensure that everyone gets a nice slice of the pie, before anyone goes in for seconds.

Example:
If the first of two investors (1/2) invests $100, then the second of two investors (2/2) will only be able to invest up to $200 (which is 100% of the current average investment [2x]).
If the first investor has a net increase in their investment, then the second investor would be able to invest more money into the system.
